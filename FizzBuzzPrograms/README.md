# FizzBuzz Challenges

### FizzBuzz is a programming challenge that is use to evaluate developers general problem solving skills.

In FizzBuzz developers are expect to erite a program that print numbers from 1 - 100 but with three exceptions.

- For every number that is divisible by 3 and 5, console log ```"FizzBuzz"```
- For every number that is divisible by only 3 and not 5, console log ```"Fizz"```
- For every number that is divisible by only 5 and not 3, console .log "```Buzz```"

### Here is a partial example with numbers from 12 to 20:

    "Fizz"
    13
    14
    "FizzBuzz"
    16
    17
    "Fizz"
    19
    "Buzz"
